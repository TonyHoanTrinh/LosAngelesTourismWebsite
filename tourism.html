				The sprawling city of Los Angeles, in Southern California, has long been known internationally in the film and entertainment
				industry, particularly for Hollywood, a place that has drawn aspiring actors and actresses from across the country for almost
				a century. Today, LA is a culturally diverse city, with a growing culinary scene, incredible shopping, outstanding museums,
				and a reputation for being the creative center of America. Sun seekers coming to enjoy the warm climate and beaches will find
				all kinds of things to do and interesting neighborhoods to explore. Recent upgrades to the public transportation network and the
				addition of a bike share program in downtown LA have made getting around and sightseeing easier than ever. For families, nearby
				Disneyland and Universal Studios are key destinations that often warrant repeat visits. Regardless of your interests, Los Angeles
				makes a perfect getaway.

				<b> Universal Studios Hollywood </b><br> </h1>
					<p>
						Universal Studios Hollywood is a film studio and theme park in the Universal City county island (unincorporated)
						area of the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles County, California, United States. It is one of the oldest and most
						famous Hollywood film studios still in use. Its official marketing headline is "The Entertainment Capital of LA".
						It was initially created to offer tours of the real Universal Studios sets and is the first of many full-fledged
						Universal Studios Theme Parks located across the world. Woody Woodpecker is the official mascot for Universal Studios
						Hollywood. It is also the only amusement park that's entirely within the San Fernando Valley. Outside the theme park,
						a new, all-digital facility near the Universal Studios backlot was built in an effort to merge all of NBCUniversal's
						West Coast operations into one area. As a result, the current home for KNBC, KVEA and NBC News with Telemundo
						Los Angeles Bureaus with new digital facility is on the Universal lot formerly occupied by Technicolor SA. Universal
						City includes hotels Universal Hilton & Towers, the Sheraton Universal Hotel, the multi-screen Globe Theatre, often
						used for banquets and receptions and Universal CityWalk, which offers a collection of shops and restaurants. In 2013,
						the park hosted 6,148,000 guests, placing it 17th in the world and 9th among North American parks.

  						<blockquote>
							Universal Studios was one of the best experiences ever. It is a perfect day trip but make sure you go
							there early so that you can try everything at the park. The high entrance cost is totally justified with the
							experience. The new wizarding world was a total delight and was awe-inspiring to see your favourite childhood
							movie places come to life. The food at the park was fulfilling and budgeted as well with really friendly staff.
							Free lockers were provided on some of the rides which was really courteous of the management. There was no
							compromise on the safety of the rides which added more confidence on the park authorities. The experience was
							fulfilling and would definitely want to go again.

				<h1> <b> Griffith Park </b><br><br> </h1>
					<p>
						Griffith Park is a large municipal park at the eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains, in the Los Feliz
						neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. The park covers 4,310 acres (1,740 ha) of land, making it one of the
						largest urban parks in North America. It is the second-largest city park in California, after Mission Trails
						Preserve in San Diego, and the 11th largest municipally owned park in the United States. It has also been
						referred to as the Central Park of Los Angeles[citation needed] but is much larger, more untamed, and rugged
						than its New York City counterpart.

							Massive urban park with plenty of shaded areas, trails and picnic areas. Tons of places to explore and
							hike around to. Parking is difficult on weekends due to the crowds, but during the week early in the
							day isn't bad at all. This place is huge, so bring a backpack with snacks and plenty of water. Dress
							comfortably and sporty and be prepared for a great expedition. Highly recommended.

				<h1> <b> Venice Beach </b><br><br> </h1>
					<p>
						Venice is a residential, commercial and recreational beachfront neighborhood within the California
						city of Los Angeles, located in its greater Westside. Venice was founded in 1905 as a seaside resort
						town. It was an independent city until 1926, when it merged with Los Angeles. Today, Venice is known
						for its canals, beaches, and the circus-like Ocean Front Walk, a two-and-a-half-mile pedestrian-only
						promenade that features performers, mystics, artists and vendors.
						<br>
						Venice Beach, which receives millions of visitors a year, has been labeled as "a cultural hub known
						for its eccentricities" as well as a "global tourist destination." It includes the promenade
						that runs parallel to the beach (also the "Ocean Front Walk" or just "the boardwalk"), Muscle Beach,
						the handball courts, the paddle tennis courts, Skate Dancing plaza, the numerous beach volleyball
						courts, the bike trail and the businesses on Ocean Front Walk.

							Amazing sights to see on Venice beach - lots of LA life. We visited during the day walking right to
							Santa Monica pier and back - long walk but really enjoyed it. We also visited at night and found the
							atmosphere a bit edgy, didn't feel totally comfortable. Best to visit in afternoon when Venice Beach
							life has got into full swing.
