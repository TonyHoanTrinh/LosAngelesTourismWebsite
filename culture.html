					There’s nothing quite like experiencing concerts in Los Angeles, whether it’s a stadium show with
					tens of thousands of screaming fans, or a late night jazz session in an intimate club. LA’s world
					class venues include the stunning Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Nokia Theatre at L.A. Live in
					Downtown LA, Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre, and the historic Wiltern and the Palladium. LA's year-round
					sunny weather is ideal for enjoying outdoor concerts at the Hollywood Bowl, Greek Theatre and
					John Anson Ford Theatre. Music festivals and free concerts include the Grand Performances at
					California Plaza, the Music Spotlight Series at Universal CityWalk, and the Twilight Dance Series
					at the Santa Monica Pier. Concerts happen every night in smaller clubs like the Conga Room and
					the House of Blues Sunset Strip.

					Los Angeles has over 1,600 murals throughout the city that touch on a variety of subjects. The Chandler
					Outdoor Gallery is a collection of murals in the NoHo Arts District. Hollywood’s urban art is more
					celebrity-focused, such as “Hollywood Jazz 1945-1972” on the iconic Capitol Records building,
					“You Are the Star” on Wilcox, and “Dolores del Rio” on Hudson. In Downtown L.A., “The Pope of Broadway”
					depicts actor Anthony Quinn dancing on the side of the Victor’s Clothing Building. “Los Angeles Teachers”
					features Edward James Olmos in character alongside Jaime Escalante in a mural located behind East L.A.’s
					famous El Mercado marketplace. For urban art from a different point of view, Metro's Art Department has
					commissioned more than 300 artists to incorporate art into transportation projects throughout L.A.
					County.

				Film and Television
				<br> <br>
					Los Angeles locations have made countless appearances in films and TV episodes. Downtown L.A.’s City
					Hall, Union Station, Millennium Biltmore Hotel and the Bradbury Building have had starring roles for
					decades. Historic Hollywood locations include landmarks such as Yamashiro Restaurant and the Hollywood
					Roosevelt Hotel. L.A.’s natural landscape provides numerous locations, whether it’s Santa Monica beach
					for Baywatch or Vasquez Rocks, as seen in Star Trek. For over a century, L.A. has been the home of
					legendary studios, where silent movies, the latest blockbusters and hit TV shows have been shot.
					Must-sees for fans are tours of Universal Studios, Warner Brothers, Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures. And a sure way to get on TV is to attend a taping of a game show or talk show at a major network studio.

					When it comes to fashion, Los Angeles has always been a city ahead of the curve. Fashionistas should
					head straight to the Fashion District in Downtown L.A., one of the best shopping areas in the world
					for cutting edge fashion and bargain prices. Visit La Brea Avenue for trendy gear and vintage clothing,
					or stroll nearby West Third Street and its many boutiques. The jet set park their Ferraris on famed
					Rodeo Drive for the ultimate luxury items, while mere mortals can shop with the stars on Robertson Blvd. Celebrities have also made Ventura Blvd. in the Valley a hotspot for vintage and high end fashion alike. Tomorrow’s fashion superstars are being created today at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising (FIDM), where the public can attend the annual DEBUT Runway Show, and fashion exhibits at the FIDM museum.
